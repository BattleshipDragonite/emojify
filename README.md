## About the Project
Oftentimes we're stuck listening to the same ol' songs from the same ol' artists, all playing the same ol' genres. But what if you want to venture out and discover music you've never heard before? What if instead of manually researching new artists or waiting for your next Discover Weekly playlist, you could surprise yourself with a completely novel playlist of songs based on parameters you set by how you *feel*?

### Introducing...Emojify!
Using the app is easy - simply sign in with your Spotify account, select a genre emoji, mess around with the various parameters, and see what songs get recommended! You can then choose to listen to a 30-second preview of the song and either add the current selection to your draft playlist or hear the next song that was returned based on the current parameters. Once you're satisifed with your draft playlist you can then choose to add it to your Spotify account and listen to your brand new playlist anytime you want.

**Wait wait...everything's in emojis! How do I know what genre I'm selecting or what each of the parameters mean?**
That's the point! We have intentionally left everything vague to encourage to try and find something new or something you haven't listened to before. We also wanted to add a layer of fun in allowing you to try and guess what each emoji represents (I wonder what emoji represents the *rock* genre ðŸ¤”).
